# In command, define the following: "aws <service> <operation>"
command: aws s3api list-buckets

# This is where you define optional arguments.
 
# This could be thought of as an M-ary tree,
# where nodes equal to arguments and their values
# (with arguments and their values alternating).
 
# When parsing, the dictionaries are traversed recursively.
# While traversing, store any found key-value pairs into "namespace".
# However, if the "value" is dictionart or list, any
# other key-value pairs are stored/checked and then s  
 
# It is possible to provide "fallback" values of sorts
# by defining value for argument at lesser level of nesting
# and then rewriting it as willed at higher levels of nesting.
 
# Values for branches can be of following types:
# - String  - simple string value without further nesting.
# - Integer - same as strings, no further nesting.
# - Boolean - used when defining value-less (toggle) arguments.
#             True includes the argument,
#             False discards the argument from namespace,
#             if it was provided in above levels
#             (acts as if the argument wasn't provided).
# - null    - used to "opt-out" of (discard) fallback value for argument.
# - List    - should contain strings and integers
#             which are provided as argument values.
#             Lists can only be values of "--argument" keys.
# - Dict    - Used to nest further, enabling the user
#             to define additional optional arguments.
